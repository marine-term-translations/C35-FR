    original: "Predominantly moderately wave-exposed bedrock and boulders, subject to moderately strong to weak tidal streams. On the bedrock and stable boulders there is typically a narrow band of kelp [Laminaria digitata] in the sublittoral fringe which lies above a [Laminaria hyperborea] forest and park. Associated with the kelp are communities of seaweeds, predominantly reds and including a greater variety of more delicate filamentous types than found on more exposed coasts (cf. A3.11)."
