  original: 'Shores of mixed sediments ranging from muds with gravel and sand components
    to mixed sediments with pebbles, gravels, sands and mud in more even proportions.
    By definition, mixed sediments are poorly sorted. Stable large cobbles or boulders
    may be present which support epibiota such as fucoids and green seaweeds more
    commonly found on rocky and boulder shores. Mixed sediments which are predominantly
    muddy tend to support infaunal communities which are similar to those of mud and
    sandy mud shores. Situation: It is probable that there are broad transition areas
    between areas of mudflat or sandy mudflat, and mixed sediment biotopes where the
    sediment consists principally of mud but has significant proportions of gravel
    and sand mixed in. Gravelly mud may occur in patches on mudflats. Similarly, there
    is unlikely to be an easily defined boundary between areas of mixed sediment with
    stable cobbles and boulders, and boulder fields which fall into the rocky shore
    category.'
