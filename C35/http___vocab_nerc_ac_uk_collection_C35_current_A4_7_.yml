    original: "Circalittoral rock features include circalittoral fouling communities (A4.72) and circalittoral caves and overhangs (A4.71). These features are present throughout the circalittoral zone in a variety of wave exposures and tidal streams. Two fouling subtypes have also been identified: A4.722 has been recorded from disused fishing nets and other artificial substrata, and is characterised by aggregations of [Ascidiella aspersa] whilst A4.721 has been recorded from steel wrecks, and is characterised by dense aggregations of [Alcyonium digitatum] and [Metridium senile]. Habitats in hard substrata in the circalittoral zone characterised by the presence of seeping or bubbling gases, oils or water are also included (A4.73)."
