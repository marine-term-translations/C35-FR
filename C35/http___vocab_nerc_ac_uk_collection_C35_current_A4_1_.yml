  original: Occurs on extremely wave-exposed to exposed circalittoral bedrock and
    boulders subject to tidal streams ranging from strong to very strong. Typically
    found in tidal straits and narrows. The high energy levels found within this habitat
    complex are reflected in the fauna recorded. Sponges such as [Pachymatisma johnstonia],
    [Halichondria panicea], [Esperiopsis fucorum] and [Myxilla incrustans] may all
    be recorded. Characteristic of this habitat complex is the dense 'carpet ' of
    the hydroid [Tubularia indivisa]. The barnacle [Balanus crenatus] is recorded
    in high abundance on the rocky substrata. On rocky outcrops, [Alcyonium digitatum]
    is often present.
