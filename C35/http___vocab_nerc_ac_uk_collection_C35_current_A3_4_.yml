  original: 'Rock habitats in the Baltic infralittoral zone which are exposed to wave
    action, currents or ice scouring. The exposure status is that impacting on the
    area concerned at the relevant scale. Thus there may be enclaves of different
    exposure status caused by localised variation in relief (e.g. steeper rock in
    more moderately exposed or even sheltered areas). Note that it has been proposed
    that ?exposed? has an effective fetch of greater than 25 km: this requires verification
    across the Baltic.'
