    original: "A water column which is unmixed or only partially mixed because the depth of the water body is greater than the depth of mixing. Salinity is the same as that in adjacent seawater. This habitat type shows pronounced vertical stratification (e.g. caused by atmospheric temperature). The subtypes are separated at level 4 by the cause and degree of persistence of the gradient ? e.g. seasonal temperature gradients or persistent salinity gradients."
