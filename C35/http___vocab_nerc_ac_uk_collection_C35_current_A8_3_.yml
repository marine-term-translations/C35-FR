  original: During freezing of seawater, salt is rejected from the ice crystals. The
    remaining brine solution forms a three-dimensional network of tubes and channels
    with typical diameters of 200 ?m within the ice matrix. Despite the harsh environmental
    conditions (low light intensities, low temperature, high salinity), a specialised
    community has developed and adapted to live within the brine channel system. Minute
    unicellular algae like diatoms are the dominant primary producers.
