  original: A water column which is unmixed or only partially mixed because the depth
    of the water body is greater than the depth of mixing, and with short residence
    time, defined as changing diurnally. Salinity is reduced relative to the adjacent
    fully marine seawater. This habitat type is usually found in deeper coastal water
    situations and is the result of river inflow or ice melt. Note that some discretion
    should be used in the interpretation of ?adjacent?, for example in the Baltic
    Sea, ?adjacent? fully marine seawater is reached only in the Kattegat. Unstratified
    water columns have very weak or no horizontal or vertical gradients.
