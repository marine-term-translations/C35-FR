  original: 'Littoral coarse sediments include shores of mobile pebbles, cobbles and
    gravel, sometimes with varying amounts of coarse sand. The sediment is highly
    mobile and subject to high degrees of drying between tides. As a result, few species
    are able to survive in this environment. Beaches of mobile cobbles and pebbles
    tend to be devoid of macroinfauna, while gravelly shores may support limited numbers
    of crustaceans, such as [Pectenogammarus planicrurus]. Situation: Littoral coarse
    sediments are found along relatively exposed open shores, where wave action prevents
    finer sediments from settling. Coarse sediments may also be present on the upper
    parts of shores where there are more stable, sandy biotopes on the lower and mid
    shore. Temporal variation: The sediment particle size structure may vary seasonally,
    with relatively finer sediments able to settle during calmer conditions in summer.
    Where the sediment grain size is very large (at the interface between sediment
    and boulder shores), cobbles may be mobile during exposed winter conditions, but
    stable enough during summer months to support limited juvenile rocky shore epifauna
    (e.g. juvenile barnacles).'
