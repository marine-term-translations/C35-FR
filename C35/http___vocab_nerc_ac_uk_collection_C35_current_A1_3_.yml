    original: "Sheltered to extremely sheltered rocky shores with very weak to weak tidal streams are typically characterised by a dense cover of fucoid seaweeds which form distinct zones (the wrack [Pelvetia canaliculata] on the upper shore through to the wrack [Fucus serratus] on the lower shore). Where salinity is reduced (such as at the head of a sea loch or where streams run across the shore) [Fucus ceranoides] may occur. Fucoids also occur on less stable, mixed substrata (cobbles and pebbles on sediment) although in lower abundance and with fewer associated epifaunal species; beds of mussels [Mytilus edulis] are also common. In summer months, dense blankets of ephemeral green and red seaweeds can dominate these mixed shores. Two biological subtypes have been described: Dense blankets of fucoid seaweeds dominating sheltered, fully marine littoral rocky shores (A1.31) and fucoids dominating variable salinity rocky shores (A1.32)."
