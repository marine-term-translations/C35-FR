  original: A water column which is unmixed or only partially mixed because the depth
    of the water body is greater than the depth of mixing. Salinity is the same as
    that in adjacent seawater. Horizontal gradients give rise to fronts, which are
    separated at level 4 by the degree of persistence of the stratification ? ephemeral
    such as eddies, gyres and upwellings; seasonal upwellings; or persistent water
    mass interfaces.
