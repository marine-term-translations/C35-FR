  original: 'The boundary layer between sea ice and the water column with special
    abiotic (e.g. temperature, salinity) and biotic (e.g. food resources) factors,
    which also vary with season and region. This habitat is colonized by autochthonous
    under-ice amphipods ([Apherusa glacialis], [Onisimus] spp., [Gammarus wilkitzkii]),
    which live directly at the ice underside and complete their entire life-cycle
    here, and allochthonous sub-ice fauna, organisms originating either from the ice
    interior or the pelagic realm, which are found in this boundary layer temporarily,
    e.g. for feeding or during certain life stages. There is some evidence that the
    first metres below the ice are strongly stratified, particularly during the melt
    period in summer. Source: http://www.awi-bremerhaven.de/Climate/WorkingGroups/ofis/ARK-19-1/sea-ice-biology.htm.'
