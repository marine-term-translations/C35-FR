  original: A water column which is unmixed or only partially mixed because the depth
    of the water body is greater than the depth of mixing. Salinity is reduced relative
    to the adjacent fully marine seawater. This habitat type is usually found in deeper
    coastal water situations and is the result of river inflow or ice melt. Note that
    some discretion should be used in the interpretation of ?adjacent?, for example
    in the Baltic Sea, ?adjacent? fully marine seawater is reached only in the Kattegat.
    Medium residence time is defined as changing over time preiods greater than daily
    and up to about 14 days (based on the time required for the phytoplankton population
    to double) and long residence time lasting longer than 14 days.
