  original: 'Shores of fine particulate sediment, mostly in the silt and clay fraction
    (particle size less than 0.063 mm in diameter), though sandy mud may contain up
    to 40% sand (mostly very fine and fine sand). Littoral mud typically forms extensive
    mudflats, though dry compacted mud can form steep and even vertical structures,
    particularly at the top of the shore adjacent to saltmarshes. Little oxygen penetrates
    these cohesive sediments, and an anoxic layer is often present within millimetres
    of the sediment surface. Littoral mud can support communities characterised by
    polychaetes, bivalves and oligochaetes. Most muddy shores are subject to some
    freshwater influence, as most of them occur along the shores of estuaries. Mudflats
    on sheltered lower estuarine shores can support a rich infauna, whereas muddy
    shores at the extreme upper end of estuaries and which are subject to very low
    salinity often support very little infauna. Situation: Muddy shores are principally
    found along the shores of estuaries where there is enough shelter from wave action
    to allow fine sediment to settle. Muddy shores may also be present in sheltered
    inlets, straits and embayments which are not part of major estuarine systems.
    Temporal variation: [Enteromorpha] spp. and [Ulva lactuca] may form mats on the
    surface of the mud during the summer months, particularly in areas of nutrient
    enrichment or where there is significant freshwater influence.'
