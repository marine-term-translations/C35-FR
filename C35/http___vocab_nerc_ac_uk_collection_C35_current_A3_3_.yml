    original: "Infralittoral rock in wave and tide-sheltered conditions, supporting silty communities with [Laminaria hyperborea] and/or [Laminaria saccharina] (A3.31). Associated seaweeds are typically silt-tolerant and include a high proportion of delicate filamentous types. In turbid-water estuarine areas, the kelp and seaweeds (A3.32) may be replaced by animal-dominated communities (A3.36) whilst stable hard substrata in lagoons support distinctive communities (A3.34)."
