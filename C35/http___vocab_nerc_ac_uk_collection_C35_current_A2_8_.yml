    original: "Features of littoral sediment include littoral habitats characterised by the presence of gases or liquids bubbling or seeping through sediments (A2.81); areas which are characterised by pioneer or ephemeral red and green algae because of variations in salinity and/or siltation (A2.82); and sedimentary shores of non-tidal, reduced salinity waters which are below the mean water level and normally water-covered, but which are regularly or occasionally exposed by the action of wind (hydrolittoral zone in the Baltic) (A2.83-A2.87)."
