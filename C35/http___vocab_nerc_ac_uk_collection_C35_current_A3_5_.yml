  original: 'Rock habitats in the Baltic infralittoral zone which are moderately exposed
    to wave action, currents or ice scouring. The exposure status is that impacting
    on the area concerned at the relevant scale. Thus there may be enclaves of different
    exposure status caused by localised variation in relief (e.g. steeper rock in
    sheltered areas). Note that it has been proposed that ?exposed? has an effective
    fetch of 5 ? 25 km: this requires verification across the Baltic.'
