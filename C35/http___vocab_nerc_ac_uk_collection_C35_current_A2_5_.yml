  original: Angiosperm-dominated stands of vegetation, occurring on the extreme upper
    shore of sheltered coasts and periodically covered by high tides. The vegetation
    develops on a variety of sandy and muddy sediment types and may have admixtures
    of coarser material. The character of the saltmarsh communities is affected by
    height up the shore, resulting in a zonation pattern related to the degree or
    frequency of immersion in seawater.
