  original: 'Rock habitats in the Baltic infralittoral zone which are sheltered from
    wave action, currents or ice scouring. The exposure status is that impacting on
    the area concerned at the relevant scale. Thus there may be enclaves of different
    exposure status caused by localised variation in relief (e.g. sheltered areas
    within exposed or moderately exposed areas). Note that it has been proposed that
    ?exposed? has an effective fetch less than 5 km: this requires verification across
    the Baltic.'
