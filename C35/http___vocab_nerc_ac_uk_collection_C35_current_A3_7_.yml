  original: Includes surge gulleys (A3.71), which are found throughout the infralittoral
    rock zone, and usually consist of vertical bedrock walls, occasionally with overhanging
    faces, and support communities, which reflect the degree of wave surge they are
    subject to and any scour from mobile substrata on the cave/gully floors. The larger
    cave and gully systems, such as found in Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles and
    St Kilda, typically show a marked zonation from the entrance to the rear of the
    gully/cave as wave surge increases and light reduces. Also includes habitats in
    hard substrata in the infralittoral zone characterised by the presence of seeping
    or bubbling gases, oils or water (A3.73) and recently colonised artificial hard
    substrata in the infralittoral zone (A3.72).
